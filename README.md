# Gifplayer

Use `<gif src="image.gif"></gif>` to add a gif to a page. It'll be rendered as a static image and only play when the user hovers their mouse over it.

Add a style object to control the size, eg `style={{ width: 200 }}`. At this time only numeric sizes work.

Play on click/touch coming soon.
